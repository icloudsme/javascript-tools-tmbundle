JavaScript Tools TextMate Bundle
--------------------------------
v0.2.7 (Fri May 23 20:50:31 MDT 2008) -- john muhl
+ Add environment variables for YUI! compressor options, character set and preserve semi-colons

v0.2.6 (Sat May 17 20:14:50 EDT 2008) -- Thomas Aylott
+ Now you can just set and environment variable to toggle the Packr base62 option

v0.2.5 (Sat May 17 15:20:43 MDT 2008) -- john muhl
+ Update the Dean Edwards packer command to use the Packr ruby library instead of the older PHP one.
  Packr is based on Packer v3 so we also get an upgraded Packer implementation. This also means the
  Packr library has been added to Support/bin. Only minor modifications were made to the packr.rb
  file in order to get it to run from within TextMate instead of your RAILS_ROOT.

v0.2.4 (Sat May 17 13:19:15 MDT 2008) -- john muhl
+ Update custom_rhino.jar to the latest from <http://dojotoolkit.org/docs/shrinksafe>

v0.2.3 (Sat May 17 10:25:29 MDT 2008) -- john muhl
+ Move help.markdown to README.markdown for better github face
+ Updated help command to fetch README.markdown
+ Updated README.markdown so the documentation is actually for the people who
  need help, not the people who wrote the bundle

v0.2.2 (Tue Mar 11 15:37:09 MDT 2008) -- john muhl
+ Added YUI! Compressor version 2.3.5 plus 1 new command "YUI! Compressor
  (current file)" which takes the current file as input and replaces it with
  the compressor'd version
 
v0.2.1 (Fri May 25 12:57:54 EDT 2007) -- Robert Rasmussen
+ Fixed TODO: "figure out why I can't use bracketed expressions and regexp
  captures within the same string"
 
v0.2.1 (Thu Feb 15 16:56:45 EST 2007) -- Thomas Aylott
+ Upgraded to JSLint 0.3.0 and merged into a single universal binary using:
  lipo ppc/jsl intel/jsl -create -output jsl && strip jsl && ls -l jsl
+ Added a bunch of reformatting macros. 
  They need to be converted into ruby scripts but are marginally useful asis.
 
v0.2 (Thu Feb 15 14:20:13 EST 2007) -- Thomas Aylott
+ Made everything more "textmate-like"
+ New Minimize Selection command to replace the "upwrap paragraph" command
+ Added to bundleforge
 
v0.1.1 (10/3/2006) -- Harald Marin Ström (http://burnfield.com/martin/)
+ Added a PPC binary of jsl.
+ Added more precision to the line-number hyperlinks.  They now take you to
  the proper line *and* column, and will focus the proper file even if it is
  not the frontmost document.
 
v0.1.0 -- Andrew Dupont (http://www.andrewdupont.net/2006/10/01/javascript-tools-textmate-bundle/)
+ Initial version.
